This is program is basically a clicker game about 'fixing' the LUT wind turbine.
The program has a store with some fun functions, a leaderboard and all sorts of secret fun stuff.

To get it to run, follow these steps.
- Copy the .env file provided to the backend folder.
- Run 'npm install' in both the root- and backend directories.
- Open developer terminals by writing 'npm start' and 'npm run server' in seperate terminals
- And voila! You can find the program running in your localhost:3000 port.

This program was made as a group effort in Visma 2021 React Code Camp.
